- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance definitely simplifies my code, and makes it easy to debug.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Almost everything method and error I got was new, so I recommend acknowledging that your default is not knowing and just research everything. Also Java documentation is a good friend. 
The Hastable data structure was very troublesome since it is deprecated.
